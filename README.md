## Semester-Project-ADA
# Semester Project conducted alone for the Advanced Data Analysis course at HEC Lausanne
My aim during this project was to see if we could predict the populartiy of a song by it's attributes. Music's popularity has been a very subjective term, and with the rise of Spotify, more and more people dream to make it out by following their passion for music, unfortunately, just a very small part of them make it. 
I used Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to carry out this project.
Results are promising, even though we could have taken them even further by encoding the artists names, or by using Natural Language Processing to get a view of the lyrics as well. 
One can imagine that if these models are taken even further, it could be possible to get the perfect hit recipe and help some artists to follow their dream and pursue a career in music by helping them produce songs that are a perfect mix of the relevant attributes.
Thank you for reading this project, I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.
